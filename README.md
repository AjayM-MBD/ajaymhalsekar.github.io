## How to publish on GitHub Pages (no cost)
1. Create a repository named `yourusername.github.io` (you said you created an account).
2. Upload all files from this package to the repository root.
3. Commit and push. GitHub Pages will serve the site at `https://yourusername.github.io` within seconds.

## Notes
- Edit the files directly on GitHub to update content.
- Add more blog posts in the `/blog` folder as separate HTML files or convert to Markdown if you prefer.
- If you want a custom domain later, GitHub Pages supports it.
